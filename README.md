# Sovrin -- identity for all

Sovrin Identity Network public/permissioned distributed ledger

This codebase contains the code to run Sovrin validator or observer
nodes, as well as the CLI that interacts with the ledger.

Developers should explore the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/getting-started.md) to learn how Sovrin works.

Have a look at [Setup Instructions](https://github.com/sovrin-foundation/sovrin/blob/master/setup.md)
to understand how to work with the code. Note that setup instructions are
still changing hour-by-hour as we identify
install preconditions.
